Perform multiplication of 167 * 28 without a mult opcode
stores 167 in an accumulator as 0xa7 and adds 0xa7 to it 27 times
by storing a counter as 0x1c and removing 0x01 from it each loop
until the zero flag is set
```{r}
mult_asm <- readr::read_fwf(system.file("asm", "mult.asm", package = "rx86"), 
                            col_positions = readr::fwf_widths(c(3, 6, 20)))
colnames(mult_asm) <- c("addr", "bytecode", "instr")
```
```{r}
# blank slate
mem <- create_mem(len = 64)
registers <- create_reg()
```

```{r}
runasm(mult_asm)
```

```{r}
# extract result from memory
mem[sanitize(0x22)]
#     0x22 
# "0x1244" 
as.integer(mem[sanitize(0x22)])
# [1] 4676
167*28
# [1] 4676
```

# The book Code (Petzold) achieves this with a high and low bit calculation but 
# I'm not sure how to adapt what I have for 8 bit where 0xff === -1
