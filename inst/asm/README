Based on 'Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software'

by Charles Petzold, this multiplies the values stored at addresses 0x20 (a) and 0x21 (b) and
stores the result (a*b) at 0x22.

This does not make use of a MUL operation but rather performs n=b additions of a.

For this reason, it would be wise to set the value at 0x21 to be the smaller of the two.
